The remix of "Where Are You Now" by Lost Frequencies featuring Calum Scott shows strong commercial potential due to its association with two established artists and its fit within the popular electronic/dance genre. The track benefits from the emotional depth of Calum Scott's vocals, combined with a high-energy remix that appeals to both EDM fans and mainstream pop listeners. The production quality is professional, with a clear, high-fidelity sound, making it suitable for streaming and playlist placement on platforms like Spotify and Apple Music. The trackâ€™s relatively short length aligns with modern streaming trends, increasing its chances for repeat listens and exposure. However, its success largely depends on how it is marketed and distributed, especially if this remix is unofficial. Leveraging social media platforms, playlist placements, and collaborations with influencers would significantly enhance its reach.

While the track has solid technical aspects and established artist recognition, the marketing and promotional efforts will be key in determining its performance in a highly competitive music landscape. If marketed effectively, the remix could enjoy strong engagement from both EDM and pop audiences, potentially landing in popular playlists and gaining traction in clubs or at festivals. Overall, the track shows good promise but will require strategic promotion to unlock its full commercial potential.
